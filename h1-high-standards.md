## b) Tie It to the Standard

Not sure if I fully grasped what the exercise was about but here's a table:

|   Interested Party  | Need/Expectation/Requirement | ISO 27001 Requirement Area | Evidence/Demonstration |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Me (Owner and user) |    Continuity of exercises   |      Operation    | Snapshots and backups (if necessary) of exercises, documentation. |
|   Course Organizer  |    Academic integrity,                           |     Leadership/Planning     |                        |
|                     |                              |                             |                        |
|                     |                              |                             |                        |
