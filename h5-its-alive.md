### h5 It's Alive!

*Disclaimer: I was absent from this weeks class so if something is done differently than shown in the class that's why.*


## a) Lab1

The objective this time around is to investigate a program and see what's wrong with it and then fix it. First off we have to download the necessary labs, which you can do from the course site or moodle. I'll skip the boring parts like showing how to download and extract the files and we'll just jump in and see what we're working with.

After navigating to our directory have three files: `gdb_example1`, `gdb_example1.c` and `Makefile`.

Let's start this figuring this out by running the already compiled program:

!pic

So yeah the program didn't do what it's supposed to as we can see and had a Segmentation fault. Segmentation faults happen when we try to access memory in a way that's not possible. I found a nice and simple explanation of it in this [Stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2346806/what-is-a-segmentation-fault). Here's also a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segmentation_fault) that goes more indepth with it.

So now we have a hint about what type of error our program is running into which helps us in the actual investigation part.
