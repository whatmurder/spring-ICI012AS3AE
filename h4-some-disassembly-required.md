## a) Install Ghidra

I decided to install Kali Linux for this one since you can get a more modern *Ghidra* for this.

I went to Kali.org and downloaded the VirtualBox .vdi file, imported it and then updated the system with

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

After that I rebooted the system and now it's time to install *Ghidra*.
To install *Ghidra* on Kali you simply run 

```
sudo apt-get install ghidra
```

After the installation we got a License Agreement which we accept and boom:

!pic 

Ghidra installed!
